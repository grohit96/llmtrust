# LLMTrust

**AI outputs can hallucinate, leak secrets, and can’t be verified. LLMTrust is a security gateway that solves this.**

---

## 🚩 Problem

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but risky to use directly:

- They may **hallucinate facts** and present them as truth.
- They may **leak sensitive data** from user prompts.
- Their outputs cannot be **independently verified or audited**.

This makes AI adoption difficult in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government) where **trust and compliance** are non-negotiable.

## 🔑 Solution

**LLMTrust** is a neutral **security and trust gateway** that sits between users and AI models. It:

1. **Filters Inputs**  
   Removes secrets, PII, and blocks prompt-injection attacks before reaching the model.

2. **Verifies Outputs**  
   Extracts key claims, checks them against trusted corpora, and labels them (✔ Verified / ⚠ Contested / ❓ Unknown).

3. **Cryptographically Signs Responses**  
   Every answer is stamped with a digital signature, making it tamper-evident and auditable.

Think of it as the **JWT/OAuth2 of AI responses** — a standard way to ensure provenance, auditability, and trust.

Verified + Signed Response

## 🎯 Why It Matters

- **For Users**: See which parts of an AI answer are reliable.
- **For Companies**: Prove to auditors and regulators that outputs are secure and verified.
- **For Everyone**: Establish a trust layer that could become as standard as JWT or OAuth2 for AI.

## 🚀 Next Steps (MVP Roadmap)

- ✅ Step 1: Define vision & repo (this README).
- ✅ Step 2: Build API skeleton (`/chat`, `/verify`).
- 🔄 Step 3: Add input sanitization + output signing.
- 🔄 Step 4: Add claim verification with citations.
- 🔄 Step 5: Demo web UI + blog post launch.
